//  ItemCard Component renders teh image and title for item of clothing
//    the image is an interactive element, so
//    if the user clicks on it, the itemModel will open

//  Note: the item card itself does not know about the modal state

//  Need to pass the state down from App to Main
//    i.e., when user clicks on image,
//    you need to call the state change function 'handleCardClick()
//    that ItemCard receives as a prop
//
