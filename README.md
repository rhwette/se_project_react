# Getting Started with Create React App

# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The WTWR project utilizes Javascript and React to develop a multi-view website which reports weather conditions for a particular location defined by lat and long. Clothing items appropriate for weather conditions are suggested to the person accessing the site. Additonally, temperatures are reported in Fahrenheit and Celsius alternately using the React contextual feature.

The project is instantiated using the CRA command (create react application) which streamlines the buildout. Functional Components are used exclusively throughout the project in favor of the more cumbersome Class Components. Along with the Functional Components, a series of React Hooks are used to dictate 'State' and 'Effect' as needed.
